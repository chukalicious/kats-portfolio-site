        I’m a full stack web developer living in Los Angeles. I love learning
        and having fun while doing it. Can’t stop tinkering with things that
        catch my attention. Eager to contribute to the creation of meaningful
        tools and share what I can make with others. Love music, from La Fania
        to Joy Division. Drop by any time!
